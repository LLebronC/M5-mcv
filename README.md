# Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles with deep neural networks
Master in Computer Vision - M5 Visual recognition

## Project description
The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts, techniques, tricks and libraries to develop deep neural networks. Deep learning is the workhorse of many computer vision tasks, among them three central ones: object detection, segmentation and recognition. This project focuses on state-of-the art deep learning networks and techniques for these three problems. They will be applied to a hot topic these days, that of scene understanding for autonomous vehicles, whereby the classes of interest with regard the three tasks will be pedestrians, vehiches, road, roadside, etc.
